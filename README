Timesheet Bo

This is a personal project that I have been playing around for a few years, it is mainly for personal use at the moment,
and I use it to test any new technologies. Timesheet Bo (Bo is from the cantonese word notebook)
allows you to keep track of your working hours. It allows you to export the timesheets to produce invoices and reports.

Main functionalities:

 - Sign in using google accounts
 - Create tasks against a bill date -tasks connected to the day can be after mid-night
 - Calculate duration


Road Map
- Redmine integration
 Connect to redmine to retrieve ticket details and generate report of hours spent on each ticket - potentially push this information back o
 to the redmine ticket.
